# College Database Management System
Any college with various departments, professors, other staff members and students are required to provide their details. These details will help the faculty to decide the student's timetable and match with respective professor. Thus, a detailed database system is necessary for handling the data and updating regularly. Such process can be done with a common website/portal for both faculty and student to log in to and perform the necessary actions (such as to check their attendance, timetable, and marks). Throughout the completion of the academics, a student can access his/her details, whereas faculty won't need to worry about keeping the attendance records in any physical form.
